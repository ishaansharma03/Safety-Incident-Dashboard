## 💬 A Few Design Decisions

- I kept the UI minimal and clean — no unnecessary elements, just what's needed.
- Focused on **clarity and usability**: quick filters, smooth toggles, easy reporting.
- Flexbox made the layout responsive without heavy libraries.
- Basic input validation ensures users submit clean data.
- Hover effects + clean card layouts to give the dashboard a light, polished feeling.
